#+TITLE: torrents-csv.el
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

=torrents-csv.el= is a package for GNU Emacs that acts as a front-end to the repository of torrents, [[https://torrents-csv.com/][torrents.csv]].

While the database isn‚Äôt the most comprehensive repository of all torrents, it does track a good chunk of the ones that at least have one active seeder. And as such, it can be a search-engine for torrents without ever leaving the comfort of an Emacs buffer.

Even though one can self-host the database, I rely on the ‚Äúdemo‚Äù server, i.e., [[https://torrents-csv.com][torrents-csv.com]].

* Installation
The package can be installed directly from this repository using =straight=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package torrents-csv
    :straight '(torrents-csv
      	      :host codeberg
      	      :repo "divyaranjan/torrents-csv.el"))
#+end_src
...or if you don‚Äôt wish to rely on =straight= you can do the same with the inbuilt =:vc= argument:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package torrents-csv
    :vc (:url "https://codeberg.org/divyaranjan/torrents-csv.el"))
#+end_src
* Features
The latest version of =torrents-csv.el= supports the following:
- A neat =list-packages=-like tabulated interface with sortable columns.
- Quick fetching of magnets using button clicks or keybindings.

Here are some upcoming features that are in the works:
- Integration with [[https://github.com/skangas/mentor][mentor]] and [[https://rakshasa.github.io/rtorrent/][rTorrent]] to download torrents directly from the buffer.
- Integration with [[https://www.qbittorrent.org/][qbittorrent]] to download torrents.
- Fetch torrent file for the current entry‚Äôs magnet.
- Add =transient= support in the =torrents-list-mode=.

* Usage
Once installed, just do:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
M-x search-torrents RET
#+end_src

It will ask you to enter a query of what you wish to fetch, and almost instantly you‚Äôd have a buffer named =*Torrents Results*= with a tabulated list of torrents.

To copy the magnet of a torrent, simply press =m= or just click on the üß≤ icon for that particular row. The magnet would be copied to the =kill-ring= and can be pasted wherever you do your torrenting!

* Configuration
- You can change the number of torrent entries that get listed in =*Torrent Results*= buffer by modifying the =torrent-csv-results-count=, as such:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq torrent-csv-results-count "200")
  #+end_src
  Note that the variable is a string, which would be concatenated later on with the API URL, so putting the number inside quotes is necessary.
- If you self-host =torrents-csv= then you can change the default =torrents-csv-domain= variable to something like this:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq torrents-csv-domain "http://localhost:8657")
  #+end_src
  The port being the one with which you configured the =torrents-csv= server.
